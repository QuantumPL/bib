We introduce a generalization of the paradigmatic lambda-calculus Proto-Quipper-M, itself modeling the core features of the quantum circuit description language Quipper. The extension, called Proto-Quipper-K, is meant to capture a very general form of dynamic lifting. This is made possible by the introduction of a rich type and effect system in which not only computations, but also the very types are effectful. The main results we give for the introduced language are the classic type soundness results, namely subject reduction and progress.","tags":["proto-quipper-k","proto-quipper-m","dynamic lifting"],"title":"On Dynamic Lifting and Effect Typing in Circuit Description Languages (Extended Version)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"There are four interesting quantum PL and verification related papers being presented at POPL 2022:\n Quantum Information Effects by Robin Kaarsgaard, Chris Heunen Twist: Sound Reasoning for Purity and Entanglement in Quantum Programs by Charles Yuan, Christopher McNally, Michael Carbin Quantum Separation Logic: A Framework for Local Reasoning of Quantum Programs by Xuan-Bach Le, Jun Sun, Shang-Wei Lin, David Sanan Semantics for Variational Quantum Programming by Xiaodong Jia, Andre Kornell, Bert Lindenhovius, Michael Mislove, Vladimir Zamdzhiev  All of these papers have been added to bibliography including their appendices and expanded versions for your convenience:\n","date":1642692e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642692e3,"objectID":"c463622a5a1d4e8cc60593804a8096d9","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/event/pop22/","publishdate":"2022-01-14T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/bib/event/pop22/","section":"event","summary":"Four quantum PL papers at POPL 2022.","tags":["popl"],"title":"Quantum at POPL 2022","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xuan-Bach Le","Shang-Wei Lin","Jun Sun","David Sanan"],"categories":[],"content":"POPL \u0026lsquo;22\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642117087,"objectID":"8ea8c4f4fcc8d402775be129d698d186","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Le2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Le2022/","section":"publication","summary":"It is well-known that quantum programs are not only complicated to design but also challenging to verify because the quantum states can have exponential size and require sophisticated mathematics to encode and manipulate.

Our language is type-safe and designed for variational quantum programming, which is a hybrid classical-quantum computational paradigm. The classical subsystem of the language is the Probabilistic FixPoint Calculus (PFPC), which is a lambda calculus with mixed-variance recursive types, term recursion and probabilistic choice. The quantum subsystem is a first-order linear type system that can manipulate quantum information. The two subsystems are related by mixed classical/quantum terms that specify how classical probabilistic effects are induced by quantum measurements, and conversely, how classical (probabilistic) programs can influence the quantum dynamics. We also describe a sound and computationally adequate denotational semantics for the language. Classical probabilistic effects are interpreted using a recently-described commutative probabilistic monad on DCPO. Quantum effects and resources are interpreted in a category of von Neumann algebras that we show is enriched over (continuous) domains. This strong sense of enrichment allows us to develop novel semantic methods that we use to interpret the relationship between the quantum and classical probabilistic effects. By doing so we provide a very detailed denotational analysis that relates domain-theoretic models of classical probabilistic programming to models of quantum programming. *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages*","tags":["semantics","probabilistic programming","variational quantum programming"],"title":"Semantics for Variational Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles Yuan","Christopher McNally","Michael Carbin"],"categories":[],"content":"POPL \u0026lsquo;22.

Programming quantum computers requires awareness of entanglement, the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes of qubits are correlated. Entanglement can determine the correctness of algorithms and suitability of programming patterns. In this work, we formalize purity as a central tool for automating reasoning about entanglement in quantum programs. A pure expression is one whose evaluation is unaffected by the measurement outcomes of qubits that it does not own, implying freedom from entanglement with any other expression in the computation. We present Twist, the first language that features a type system for sound reasoning about purity. The type system enables the developer to identify pure expressions using type annotations. Twist also features purity assertion operators that state the absence of entanglement in the output of quantum gates. To soundly check these assertions, Twist uses a combination of static analysis and runtime verification. We evaluate Twist's type system and analyses on a benchmark suite of quantum programs in simulation, demonstrating that Twist can express quantum algorithms, catch programming errors in them, and support programs that existing languages disallow, while incurring runtime verification overhead of less than 3.5%. *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages*","tags":["entanglement","purity","quantum programming","type systems"],"title":"Twist: Sound Reasoning for Purity and Entanglement in Quantum Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Rand"],"categories":[],"content":"   Project Name Pronounced as     IQu haiku   LIQ$Ui|\\rangle$ liquid   OpenQASM open chasm   PLanQC plank / Planck   PyQuil pie-quill   PyZX pizzix (like physics)   Q# Q-Sharp   QASM chasm   Qbricks Q-bricks / Kubrick\u0026rsquo;s   Qiskit kiss-kit AND quiss-kit1   Quil quill   QWIRE choir   Silq silk   SQIR squire   t$|$ket$\\rangle$ ticket   VOQC vox   ZX zed ex    Bonus: Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang\u0026rsquo;s classic textbook Quantum Computation and Quantum Information is affectionately known as Mike and Ike.\n  Source: How Do You Pronounce \u0026ldquo;Qiskit?\u0026quot;; also see an older tweet from the official Qiskit account.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1640181593,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640181593,"objectID":"555b762d83e2d4dc62bd9b1fcae7633b","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/post/pronunciation-guide/","publishdate":"2021-12-22T07:59:53-06:00","relpermalink":"/bib/post/pronunciation-guide/","section":"post","summary":"Project Name Pronounced as     IQu haiku   LIQ$Ui|\\rangle$ liquid   OpenQASM open chasm   PLanQC plank / Planck   PyQuil pie-quill   PyZX pizzix (like physics)   Q# Q-Sharp   QASM chasm   Qbricks Q-bricks / Kubrick\u0026rsquo;s   Qiskit kiss-kit AND quiss-kit1   Quil quill   QWIRE choir   Silq silk   SQIR squire   t$|$ket$\\rangle$ ticket   VOQC vox   ZX zed ex    Bonus: Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang\u0026rsquo;s classic textbook Quantum Computation and Quantum Information is affectionately known as Mike and Ike.","tags":[],"title":"A Quantum PL Pronunciation Guide","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Since the last news item in July, there have been several visual and usability improvements to this QPL Bib.

Existing proposals for quantum Hoare logic either lack completeness or support only quantum variables, thus limiting their capability in practical use. In this article, we propose a quantum Hoare logic for a simple while language that involves both classical and quantum variables. Its soundness and relative completeness are proven for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs written in the language. Remarkably, with novel definitions of classical-quantum states and corresponding assertions, the logic system is quite simple and similar to the traditional Hoare logic for classical programs. Furthermore, to simplify reasoning in real applications, auxiliary proof rules are provided that support standard logical operation in the classical part of assertions and super-operator application in the quantum part. Finally, a series of practical quantum algorithms, in particular the whole algorithm of Shor's factorisation, are formally verified to show the effectiveness of the logic. *ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing*","tags":["quantum while language","quantum programming","hoare logic"],"title":"Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingsheng Ying","Li Zhou","Yangjia Li","Yuan Feng"],"categories":[],"content":"Essentially the first part of [Ying2018]\n","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636554102,"objectID":"c601d7fcfaacc6598ef2a3170ae24de3","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Ying2021a/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Ying2021a/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we define the operational and denotational semantics of a special class of parallel quantum programs, namely disjoint parallel quantum programs.

The likely arrival of scalable quantum computers in the not so distant future has resulted in a flurry of activity in the development of quantum programming languages. As in classical computing, the transition from a description of a quantum algorithm found in the literature to a hardware-specific set of instructions run on a quantum device is a complex process, prone to errors. This issue is exacerbated in the quantum setting not only by the complexity of quantum algorithms but also by the fragility of quantum information, which renders ineffective some of the classical techniques used to debug programs.  In this thesis, we contribute to the solution of some of these issues. We introduce Proto-Quipper-M, a new quantum  programming language designed to serve as a testbed for the research and development of sound mathematical semantics and reasoning techniques for quantum programs. We first present Proto-Quipper-M as a formalization of a fragment of Quipper, a high-level functional programming language for describing families of quantum circuits. In particular, we define Proto-Quipper-M as a simply-typed lambda calculus with a special type for quantum circuits and a strong type system designed to enforce linearity on quantum data, and thus prevent violations of the no-cloning property of quantum information. We endow ProtoQuipper-M with computational meaning via a big-step operational semantics and prove that the language is type-safe by showing that it enjoys the type-preservation and error-freeness properties. We also give Proto-Quipper-M a denotational semantics in a suitable class of monoidal categories and show that these categories give rise to linear-non-linear models in the sense of Benton, and thus models of intuitionistic linear logic. Finally, we crystallize the connection between the syntax and the semantics of the language by proving the soundness theorem for Proto-Quipper-M.","tags":["quantum programming languages","categorical model","quantum circuits","proto-quipper-m","category theory","quantum computing","quipper"],"title":"On a Categorically Sound Quantum Programming Language for Circuit Description","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"During our last weekly meeting, Robert and I came up with the idea of presenting the QPL bibliography that I have been maintaining at http://ks.cs.uchicago.edu/qpl-bib/ in a better way.\nSo I decided to move the GitHub repo to its own organization and set up this Hugo-based website to present publications with many filtering options.

Simulation of a general quantum program takes exponential time in the number of qubits, which makes simulation infeasible beyond 50 qubits on current supercomputers. So, for the understanding of larger programs, we turn to static techniques. In this paper, we present an abstract interpretation of quantum programs and we use it to automatically verify assertions in polynomial time. Our key insight is to let an abstract state be a tuple of projections. For such domains, we present abstraction and concretization functions that form a Galois connection and we use them to define abstract operations. Our experiments on a laptop have verified assertions about the Bernstein-Vazirani, GHZ, and Grover benchmarks with 300 qubits. *Proceedings of the 42nd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation*","tags":["quantum programming","scalability","abstract interpretation"],"title":"Quantum Abstract Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kartik Singhal","Sarah Marshall","Kesha Hietala","Robert Rand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633027596,"objectID":"80105e8ac0a1d168c03f93446a6be1c1","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Singhal2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Singhal2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Q# is a high-level programming language from Microsoft for writing and running quantum programs.

Open quantum assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of quantum circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of quantum operations. Motivated by the need for real-time classical computation, we add support for arbitrary control flow as well as calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.","tags":["qasm","quantum assembly language","openqasm","quantum computing","quantum information"],"title":"OpenQASM 3: A broader and deeper quantum assembly language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christophe Chareton","Sébastien Bardin","François Bobot","Valentin Perrelle","Benoît Valiron"],"categories":[],"content":"See extended version for additional technical material.\n","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132254,"objectID":"13be9a3ba77ae5f5bf3d571ed6698962","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Chareton2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:14.079182Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Chareton2021/","section":"publication","summary":"While recent progress in quantum hardware open the door for significant speedup in certain key areas, quantum algorithms are still hard to implement right, and the validation of such quantum programs is a challenge.

We investigate the possibilities on both quantum annealing devices (analogue quantum computers) as well as on gate-based devices (digital quantum computers). Quantum annealing devices in particular have grown in size and capabilities over the last decade. While they are natural candidates for providing improved solvers for NP-complete optimization problems, the number of qubits, accuracies and available couplings are still limited and their aptitude has yet to be confirmed. We use Monte Carlo methods and conceive an adaptive annealing schedule to assess the options to leverage them for the construction of satisfiability filters. We furthermore investigate their prospective as heuristic solvers for the traveling salesman problem, and what future enhancements in terms of geometries and couplings would be beneficial for that. Based on our simulations there is no reason to expect any benefits to leveraging analogue quantum computers over state-of-the-art classical methods. However, we see an implementation of annealing schemes on future digital devices as a promising approach that doesn't suffer from the same issues that impede performance on analogue devises. To that effect, we construct and implement an efficient quantization of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Opposed to following the common way of quantization à la Szegedy that is usually defined with respect to an oracle, we reformulate the walk to closely mimic the classical algorithm and thus circumvent having to rely on costly quantum arithmetics. Our proposed realization thereby can lead to substantial savings. While theoretical arguments promise a quadratic speedup in the asymptotic limit, we numerically confirm that a polynomial speedup in terms of minimal total time to solution can be achieved for pragmatic use. We explore the prospects of using quantum walks in a heuristic setting and estimate the gate times the would be required to outperform a classical supercomputer. Finally, we elaborate on the role of programming languages, and how software tools can accelerate the advancement of the field.

The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two sophisticated quantum algorithms, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor's algorithm. *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages*","tags":["assertion","quantum computing","program testing","quantum programming"],"title":"Projection-Based Runtime Assertions for Testing and Debugging Quantum Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seyon Sivarajah","Silas Dilkes","Alexander Cowtan","Will Simmons","Alec Edgington","Ross Duncan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631046094,"objectID":"35ba35a2dcaf3f6d030884412847adde","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Sivarajah2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Sivarajah2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We present t$|$ket$\\rangle$, a quantum software development platform produced by Cambridge Quantum Computing Ltd.

They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M by Rios \u0026 Selinger constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation. *Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science*","tags":["proto-quipper-d","fibration","categorical model","quantum programming languages","linear dependent types","proto-quipper-m"],"title":"Linear Dependent Type Theory for Quantum Programming Languages: Extended Abstract","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianjun Zhao"],"categories":["Survey"],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641051862,"objectID":"0212a47ad48d7da6bc0143763c194dc7","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Zhao2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Zhao2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum software plays a critical role in exploiting the full potential of quantum computing systems.

A fundamental reason is that dropping temporary values from the program state requires explicitly applying quantum operations that safely uncompute these values. We present Silq, the first quantum language that addresses this challenge by supporting safe, automatic uncomputation. This enables an intuitive semantics that implicitly drops temporary values, as in classical computation. To ensure physicality of Silq's semantics, its type system leverages novel annotations to reject unphysical programs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Silq programs are not only easier to read and write, but also significantly shorter than equivalent programs in other quantum languages (on average -46% for Q#, -38% for Quipper), while using only half the number of quantum primitives. *Proceedings of the 41st ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation*","tags":["quantum language","semantics","uncomputation"],"title":"Silq: A High-Level Quantum Language with Safe Uncomputation and Intuitive Semantics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romain Péchoux","Simon Perdrix","Mathys Rennela","Vladimir Zamdzhiev"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132259,"objectID":"22ebc7b26b8ebdb64aea8ace648d10ba","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Pechoux2020/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:19.730142Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Pechoux2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Inductive datatypes in programming languages allow users to define useful data structures such as natural numbers, lists, trees, and others.

This thesis makes contributions to the problems of optimizing and verifying quantum circuits, with an emphasis on the development of formal models for such purposes. We also present software implementations of these methods, which together form a full stack of tools for the design of optimized, formally verified quantum oracles. On the optimization side, we study methods for the optimization of Rz and CNOT gates in Clifford+Rz circuits. We develop a general, efficient optimization algorithm called phase folding, which reduces the number of Rz gates without increasing any metrics by computing its phase polynomial. This algorithm can further be combined with synthesis techniques for CNOT-dihedral operators to optimize circuits with respect to particular costs. We then study the optimal synthesis problem for CNOT-dihedral operators from the perspectives of Rz and CNOT gate optimization. In the case of Rz gate optimization, we show that the optimal synthesis problem is polynomial-time equivalent to minimum-distance decoding in certain Reed-Muller codes. For the CNOT optimization problem, we show that the optimal synthesis problem is at least as hard as a combinatorial problem related to Gray codes. In both cases, we develop heuristics for the optimal synthesis problem, which together with phase folding reduces T counts by 42% and CNOT counts by 22% across a suite of real-world benchmarks. From the perspective of formal verification, we make two contributions. The first is the development of a formal model of quantum circuits with ancillary bits based on the Feynman path integral, along with a concrete verification algorithm. The path integral model, with some syntactic sugar, further doubles as a natural specification language for quantum computations. Our experiments show some practical circuits with up to hundreds of qubits can be efficiently verified. Our second contribution is a formally verified, optimizing compiler for reversible circuits. The compiler compiles a classical, irreversible language to reversible circuits, with a formal, machine-checked proof of correctness written in the proof assistant F*. The compiler is structured as a partial evaluator, allowing verification to be carried out significantly faster than previous results.","tags":["quantum computing","quantum circuits","compiler optimization","formal verification"],"title":"Formal Methods in Quantum Circuit Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yipeng Huang","Margaret Martonosi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635009520,"objectID":"d3b48db9d2f18d1f117606c39f10d9e7","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Huang2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Huang2019/","section":"publication","summary":"With the advent of small-scale prototype quantum computers, researchers can now code and run quantum algorithms that were previously proposed but not fully implemented.

Probabilistic RHL was used extensively for computer-verified security proofs of classical cryptographic protocols. Since pRHL is not suitable for analyzing quantum cryptography, we present qRHL as a replacement, suitable for the security analysis of post-quantum cryptography and quantum protocols. The design of qRHL poses some challenges unique to the quantum setting, e.g., the definition of equality on quantum registers. Finally, we implemented a tool for verifying proofs in qRHL and developed several example security proofs in it. *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages*","tags":["formal verification","quantum cryptography","hoare logic"],"title":"Quantum Relational Hoare Logic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Rand","Jennifer Paykin","Dongho Lee","Steve Zdancewic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132260,"objectID":"31b67218a12f4c8b2c9a8054796c9773","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Rand2019/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:20.552494Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Rand2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Common quantum algorithms make heavy use of ancillae: scratch qubits that are initialized at some state and later returned to that state and discarded.

It has the potential to radically impact the future of information technology and influence the development of modern society. The construction of practical, general purpose quantum computers has been challenging, but quantum cryptographic and communication devices have been available in the commercial marketplace for several years. Quantum networks have been built in various cities around the world and a dedicated satellite has been launched by China to provide secure quantum communication. Such new technologies demand rigorous analysis and verification before they can be trusted in safety- and security-critical applications. Experience with classical hardware and software systems has shown the difficulty of achieving robust and reliable implementations.We present CCSq, a concurrent language for describing quantum systems, and develop verification techniques for checking equivalence between CCSq processes. CCSq has well-defined operational and superoperator semantics for protocols that are functional, in the sense of computing a deterministic input-output relation for all interleavings arising from concurrency in the system. We have implemented QEC (Quantum Equivalence Checker), a tool that takes the specification and implementation of quantum protocols, described in CCSq, and automatically checks their equivalence. QEC is the first fully automatic equivalence checking tool for concurrent quantum systems. For efficiency purposes, we restrict ourselves to Clifford operators in the stabilizer formalism, but we are able to verify protocols over all input states. We have specified and verified a collection of interesting and practical quantum protocols, ranging from quantum communication and quantum cryptography to quantum error correction. *ACM Transactions on Computational Logic*","tags":["concurrency","process calculi","equivalence checking","quantum information processing","programming language semantics"],"title":"Automated Equivalence Checking of Concurrent Quantum Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Rand"],"categories":["Survey","PhD Thesis"],"content":"Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations. 3175.

It took another fifty years for Feynman to recognize that harnessing quantum mechanics is necessary to efficiently simulate physics and for David Deutsch to propose the quantum Turing machine. After thirty more years, we are finally getting close to the first general-purpose quantum computers based upon prototypes by IBM, Intel, Google and others.  While physicists and engineers have worked on building scalable quantum computers, theoretical computer scientists have made their own advances. Complexity theorists introduced quantum complexity classes like BQP and QMA; Shor and Grover developed their famous algorithms for factoring and unstructured search. Programming languages researchers pursued two main research directions: Small-scale languages like QPL and the quantum lambda-calculi for reasoning about quantum computation and large-scale languages like Quipper and Q# for industrial-scale quantum software development. This thesis aims to unify these two threads while adding a third one: formal verification.  We argue that quantum programs demand machine-checkable proofs of correctness. We justify this on the basis of the complexity of programs manipulating quantum states, the expense of running quantum programs, and the inapplicability of traditional debugging techniques to programs whose states cannot be examined. We further argue that the existing mathematical models of quantum computation make this an easier task than one could reasonably expect. In light of these observations we introduce QWIRE, a tool for writing verifiable, large scale quantum programs.  QWIRE is not merely a language for writing and verifying quantum circuits: it is a verified circuit description language. This means that the semantics of QWIRE circuits are verified in the Coq proof assistant. We also implement verified abstractions, like ancilla management and reversible circuit compilation. Finally, we turn QWIRE and Coq's abilities outwards, towards verifying popular quantum algorithms like quantum teleportation. We argue that this tool provides a solid foundation for research into quantum programming languages and formal verification going forward.","tags":[],"title":"Formally Verified Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingsheng Ying","Li Zhou","Yangjia Li"],"categories":[],"content":"See also the published version [Ying2021a]\n","date":1538352e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132264,"objectID":"d977a33a276bf0a9c548809d4bb23271","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Ying2018/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:24.039237Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Ying2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We initiate the study of parallel quantum programming by defining the operational and denotational semantics of parallel quantum programs.

However, when the domain-specific language uses linear types, existing techniques for embedded languages fall short. Linear type systems, which have applications in a wide variety of programming domains including mutable state, I/O, concurrency, and quantum computing, can manipulate embedded non-linear data via the linear type !σ. However, prior work has not been able to produce linear embedded languages that have full and easy access to host-language data, libraries, and tools.  This dissertation proposes a new perspective on linear, embedded, domain-specific languages derived from the linear/non-linear (LNL) interpretation of linear logic. The LNL model consists of two distinct fragments---one with linear types and another with non-linear types---and provides a simple categorical interface between the two. This dissertation identifies the linear fragment with the linear embedded language and the non-linear fragment with the general-purpose host language.  The effectiveness of this framework is illustrated via a number of examples, implemented in a variety of host languages. In Haskell, linear domain-specific languages using mutable state and concurrency can take advantage of the monad that arises from the LNL model. In Coq, the QWIRE quantum circuit language uses linearity to enforce the no-cloning axiom of quantum mechanics. In homotopy type theory, quantum transformations can be encoded as higher inductive types to simplify the presentation of a quantum equational theory. These examples serve as case studies that prove linear/non-linear type theory is a natural and expressive interface in which to embed linear domain-specific languages.","tags":[],"title":"Linear/Non-Linear Types for Embedded Domain-Specific Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["{Cirq Developers}"],"categories":[],"content":"See full list of authors on Github: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/graphs/contributors\n","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132254,"objectID":"87ee6236add69fdbc425872508e3686f","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/CirqDevelopers2018/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:14.207421Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/CirqDevelopers2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Cirq is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.","tags":[],"title":"Cirq","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bert Lindenhovius","Michael Mislove","Vladimir Zamdzhiev"],"categories":["Quipper"],"content":"LICS \u0026lsquo;18.\n","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630946905,"objectID":"d6741a067d33e1943ef8a02b354c82aa","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Lindenhovius2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Lindenhovius2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Linear/non-linear (LNL) models, as described by Benton, soundly model a LNL term calculus and LNL logic closely related to intuitionistic linear logic.

It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succinct expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms. Q# provides a type system; a tightly constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax; symbolic code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations; and powerful functional constructs which aid composition. *Proceedings of the Real World Domain Specific Languages Workshop 2018*","tags":["domain specific language","functional programming","quantum computing"],"title":"Q#: Enabling Scalable Quantum Computing and Development with a High-Level DSL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Rand","Jennifer Paykin","Steve Zdancewic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132260,"objectID":"9945f53070000209a57bdf17fc84df7b","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Rand2018/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:20.165614Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Rand2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe an embedding of the QWIRE quantum circuit language in the Coq proof assistant.

The current work contributes to the semantical study of such languages by providing interaction-based semantics of a functional quantum programming language; the latter is, much like Selinger and Valiron's, based on linear lambda calculus and equipped with features like the ! modality and recursion. The proposed denotational model is the first one that supports the full features of a quantum functional programming language; we prove adequacy of our semantics. The construction of our model is by a series of existing techniques taken from the semantics of classical computation as well as from process theory. The most notable among them is Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI), categorically formulated by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott. The mathematical genericity of these techniques—largely due to their categorical formulation—is exploited for our move from classical to quantum. *Annals of Pure and Applied Logic*","tags":["higher-order computation","quantum computation","programming languages","geometry of interaction","denotational semantics","categorical semantics"],"title":"Semantics of higher-order quantum computation via geometry of interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingsheng Ying","Shenggang Ying","Xiaodi Wu"],"categories":[],"content":"POPL \u0026lsquo;17.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630946913,"objectID":"618339dbcf685a13435fa667c1f4f3c8","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Ying2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Ying2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Program invariant is a fundamental notion widely used in program verification and analysis. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) find an appropriate definition of invariants for quantum programs; and (ii) develop an effective technique of invariant generation for verification and analysis of quantum programs.  Interestingly, the notion of invariant can be defined for quantum programs in two different ways -- additive invariants and multiplicative invariants -- corresponding to two interpretations of implication in a continuous valued logic: the Lukasiewicz implication and the Godel implication. It is shown that both of them can be used to establish partial correctness of quantum programs.  The problem of generating additive invariants of quantum programs is addressed by reducing it to an SDP (Semidefinite Programming) problem. This approach is applied with an SDP solver to generate invariants of two important quantum algorithms -- quantum walk and quantum Metropolis sampling. Our examples show that the generated invariants can be used to verify correctness of these algorithms and are helpful in optimising quantum Metropolis sampling.  To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to define the notion of invariant and to develop a method of invariant generation for quantum programs. *Proceedings of the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages*","tags":["inductive assertions","quantum programming","partial correctness","invariant generation","program invariants"],"title":"Invariants of Quantum Programs: Characterisations and Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Paykin","Robert Rand","Steve Zdancewic"],"categories":[],"content":"POPL \u0026lsquo;17.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630946907,"objectID":"85ff65b8e9d96f0e1f0ac135cf31a124","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Paykin2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Paykin2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces QWIRE (\"choir\"), a language for defining quantum circuits and an interface for manipulating them inside of an arbitrary classical host language.

Commercial Quantum Key Distribution systems are easily available and several QKD networks have been built in various parts of the world. The security of the protocols used in these implementations rely on information-theoretic proofs, which may or may not reflect actual system behaviour. Moreover, testing of implementations cannot guarantee the absence of bugs and errors.

We provide a Coq library for quantum bits (qubits), quantum gates, and quantum measurement.

We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary operators.

In the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to epsilon. Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties.","tags":["proto-quipper","quipper"],"title":"Algebraic and Logical Methods in Quantum Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benoît Valiron","Neil J.

A new quantum programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of superposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of Dijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation (of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs. The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new mathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions. Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived. Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and generalizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum alternation and quantum choice. We believe that quantum programming with quantum alternation and choice will play an important role in further exploiting the power of quantum computing.","tags":[],"title":"Alternation in Quantum Programming: From Superposition of Data to Superposition of Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dave Wecker","Krysta M.

Sharir, A. Pnueli, S. Hart, Verification of probabilistic programs, SIAM Journal of Computing 13 (1984) 292--314] presented a general method for proving properties of probabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov chain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended to an invariant assertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a probabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method. In this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains which are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the Schr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In particular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification method of quantum programs is established.  - As indicated by the completeness theorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying all properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian operators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications because of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the case of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of quantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing the matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of matrices. In particular, this method enables us to compute easily the average running time and to analyze some interesting long-run behaviors of quantum programs in a finite-dimensional state space. *Science of Computer Programming*","tags":[],"title":"Verification of Quantum Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander S.

Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates.

Over the years, physicists have explored possibilities for how to implement quantum bits and logic devices in hardware. At a higher level, mathematicians and algorithmicists have explored how to express computational problems from diverse fields---such as cryptography, chemical systems simulation, and database search---in terms of mathematical equations potentially implementable in quantum hardware.  For quantum computing to become potentially viable however, research must also make inroads regarding the implementation, compilation, and architectural issues that lie between high-level mathematical algorithm expressions and low-level physical implementations. In particular, we need tools and analysis techniques that can---for a given algorithm and potential physical implementation technology---answer questions like: how much would it cost (i.e., how much resource in terms of qubits, gates, time are required?) to implement the algorithm in this technology? What is its performance potential? Is it scalable? Are there more algorithms that offer such speedups over classical computers?  Our work is building a language and toolflow to answer such questions. This document describes the Scaffold programming language, its design goals, and related tools. Scaffold is a programming language for expressing quantum algorithms. A quantum algorithm can consist of a wide variety of components (including classical and quantum routines) which will be defined using different coding techniques. As a quantum programming language (QPL), Scaffold was formulated to make it easy to express an algorithm with so many disparate components in a clean and efficient manner.

Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an Abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group.

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a \"cobordism\": a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and \"quantum topology\". But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of \"closed symmetric monoidal category\".

This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model that takes unitary operations as fundamental. Among measurement-based quantum computation methods the recently introduced one-way quantum computer stands out as basic and fundamental. The key idea is to start from an entangled state and then use measurements and one-qubit unitaries, which may be dependent on the outcomes of measurements, to guide the computation. The main point is that one never has to perform unitaries on more than one qubit at a time after the initial preparation of an entangled state. The \"programs\" that one writes in this model are traditionally called \"patterns\". In this chapter, we develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying measurement-based quantum computation.

Quantum information protocols have interesting properties which are not exhibited by their classical counterparts, but they are most distinguished for their applications in cryptography. Notable results include the unconditional security proof [1] of quantum key distribution. This result, in particular, is one of the reasons for the widespread interest in this field. Furthermore, the implementation of quantum cryptography has been demonstrated in non-laboratory settings and is already an important practical technology. Implementations of quantum cryptography have already been commercially launched and tested by a number of companies including MagiQ, Id Quantique, Toshiba, and NEC. The unconditional security of quantum key distribution protocols does not automatically imply the same degree of security for actual systems, of course; this justifies the need for systems modelling and verification in this setting. *Computer Aided Verification (CAV '08)*","tags":[],"title":"QMC: A Model Checker for Quantum Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Danos","Elham Kashefi","Prakash Panangaden"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1175385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132254,"objectID":"999ba30e55bfc47f2ee2becd073cc91d","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Danos2007/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:14.726732Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Danos2007/","section":"publication","summary":"Measurement-based quantum computation has emerged from the physics community as a new approach to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model that is based on unitary operations. Among measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way quantum computer [Raussendorf and Briegel 2001] stands out as fundamental. We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs, which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning locally and compositionally about these patterns. We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form. Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems. Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models, for example, Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is not just particular to the one-way quantum computer. *Journal of the ACM*","tags":["normalization","measurement-based quantum computing","quantum programming languages","models for quantum computing","term rewriting","teleportation-based quantum computing"],"title":"The Measurement Calculus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Rüdiger"],"categories":["Survey"],"content":"","date":1172707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132261,"objectID":"43c33fb359d63aab99a554888cf45a85","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Ruediger2007/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:21.172702Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Ruediger2007/","section":"publication","summary":"The present article gives an introductory overview of the novel field of quantum programming languages (QPLs) from a pragmatic perspective.

Our approach is based on recasting the standard axiomatic presentation of quantum mechanics, due to von Neumann, at a more abstract level, of compact closed categories with biproducts. We show how the essential structures found in key quantum information protocols such as teleportation, logic-gate teleportation, and entanglement-swapping can be captured at this abstract level. Moreover, from the combination of the -- apparently purely qualitative -- structures of compact closure and biproducts there emerge 'scalars' and a 'Born rule'. This abstract and structural point of view opens up new possibilities for describing and reasoning about quantum systems. It also shows the degrees of axiomatic freedom: we can show what requirements are placed on the (semi)ring of scalars C(I,I), where C is the category and I is the tensor unit, in order to perform various protocols such as teleportation. Our formalism captures both the information-flow aspect of the protocols (see quant-ph/0402014), and the branching due to quantum indeterminism. This contrasts with the standard accounts, in which the classical information flows are 'outside' the usual quantum-mechanical formalism. *Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science*","tags":["protocols","teleportation","performance evaluation","quantum computing","quantum entanglement","quantum mechanics","laboratories","communication channels","force measurement","measurement standards"],"title":"A Categorical Semantics of Quantum Protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krysta M.

Of particular interest are the trade-offs in performance and accuracy that can be obtained by weighing different optimization and error-correction procedures at given levels in the design hierarchy. *Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages (QPL), Turku, Finland, July 12--13, 2004*","tags":[],"title":"Toward a Software Architecture for Quantum Computing Design Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Selinger"],"categories":["Survey"],"content":"","date":1080777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132261,"objectID":"489e6969fd7f9e2c0460625ec4177cc5","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Selinger2004/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:21.466612Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Selinger2004/","section":"publication","summary":"This article is a brief and subjective survey of quantum programming language research. *Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming*","tags":["quantum computation","quantum algorithm","linear logic","denotational semantics","lambda calculus"],"title":"A Brief Survey of Quantum Programming Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

This paper investigates a possible approach to the problem of programming such machines: a template high level quantum language is presented which complements a generic general purpose classical language with a set of quantum primitives. The underlying scheme involves a run-time environment which calculates the byte-code for the quantum operations and pipes it to a quantum device controller or to a simulator. This language can compactly express existing quantum algorithms and reduce them to sequences of elementary operations; it also easily lends itself to automatic, hardware independent, circuit simplification. A publicly available preliminary implementation of the proposed ideas has been realised using the language. *European Physical Journal D: Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics*","tags":[],"title":"Toward an Architecture for Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Ömer"],"categories":["PhD Thesis"],"content":"Describes QCL\n","date":1051747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132259,"objectID":"8ea880a76849377800f84814c06a4f41","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Oemer2003/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:18.945225Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Oemer2003/","section":"publication","summary":"Describes QCL","tags":[],"title":"Structured Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emmanuel Knill"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":833587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629132257,"objectID":"04a9ea2ea431b4096558c3df72c0447c","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/Knill1996/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T16:44:17.429249Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/Knill1996/","section":"publication","summary":"A few conventions for thinking about and writing quantum pseudocode are proposed.
