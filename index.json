We investigate the possibilities on both quantum annealing devices (analogue quantum computers) as well as on gate-based devices (digital quantum computers). Quantum annealing devices in particular have grown in size and capabilities over the last decade. While they are natural candidates for providing improved solvers for NP-complete optimization problems, the number of qubits, accuracies and available couplings are still limited and their aptitude has yet to be confirmed. We use Monte Carlo methods and conceive an adaptive annealing schedule to assess the options to leverage them for the construction of satisfiability filters. We furthermore investigate their prospective as heuristic solvers for the traveling salesman problem, and what future enhancements in terms of geometries and couplings would be beneficial for that. Based on our simulations there is no reason to expect any benefits to leveraging analogue quantum computers over state-of-the-art classical methods. However, we see an implementation of annealing schemes on future digital devices as a promising approach that doesn't suffer from the same issues that impede performance on analogue devises. To that effect, we construct and implement an efficient quantization of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Opposed to following the common way of quantization à la Szegedy that is usually defined with respect to an oracle, we reformulate the walk to closely mimic the classical algorithm and thus circumvent having to rely on costly quantum arithmetics. Our proposed realization thereby can lead to substantial savings. While theoretical arguments promise a quadratic speedup in the asymptotic limit, we numerically confirm that a polynomial speedup in terms of minimal total time to solution can be achieved for pragmatic use. We explore the prospects of using quantum walks in a heuristic setting and estimate the gate times the would be required to outperform a classical supercomputer. Finally, we elaborate on the role of programming languages, and how software tools can accelerate the advancement of the field. We discuss unique aspects of quantum programming and the purpose of Q# in particular, and conclude by highlighting what developments are needed for quantum computing to live up to its potential.","tags":[],"title":"Development of Quantum Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bettina Heim","Mathias Soeken","Sarah Marshall","Chris Granade","Martin Roetteler","Alan Geller","Matthias Troyer","Krysta M.

Not only are they crucial to the programming of quantum computers at scale but also they can facilitate the discovery and development of quantum algorithms even before hardware exists that is capable of executing them.

They are used by newcomers and seasoned practitioners, researchers and developers working on the next ground-breaking discovery or applying known concepts to real-world problems. This variety in purpose and target audiences is reflected in the design and ecosystem of the existing quantum programming languages, depending on which factors a language prioritizes.

The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed.

As a consequence, no significant quantum algorithm implementation has been currently verified in a scale-invariant manner. We propose Qbricks, the first formal verification environment for circuit-building quantum programs, featuring clear separation between code and proof, parametric specifications and proofs, high degree of proof automation and allowing to encode quantum programs in a natural way, i.e. close to textbook style. Qbricks builds on best practice of formal verification for the classical case and tailor them to the quantum case: we bring a new domain-specific circuit-building language for quantum programs, namely Qbricks-DSL, together with a new logical specification language Qbricks-Spec and a dedicated Hoare-style deductive verification rule named Hybrid Quantum Hoare Logic. Especially, we introduce and intensively build upon HOPS, a higher-order extension of the recent path-sum symbolic representation, used for both specification and automation. To illustrate the opportunity of Qbricks, we implement the first verified parametric implementations of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum part of Shor integer factoring (Order Finding - Shor-OF), quantum phase estimation (QPE) - a basic building block of many quantum algorithms, and Grover search.

They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [28] constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types.

It took another fifty years for Feynman to recognize that harnessing quantum mechanics is necessary to efficiently simulate physics and for David Deutsch to propose the quantum Turing machine. After thirty more years, we are finally getting close to the first general-purpose quantum computers based upon prototypes by IBM, Intel, Google and others.  While physicists and engineers have worked on building scalable quantum computers, theoretical computer scientists have made their own advances. Complexity theorists introduced quantum complexity classes like BQP and QMA; Shor and Grover developed their famous algorithms for factoring and unstructured search. Programming languages researchers pursued two main research directions: Small-scale languages like QPL and the quantum lambda-calculi for reasoning about quantum computation and large-scale languages like Quipper and Q# for industrial-scale quantum software development. This thesis aims to unify these two threads while adding a third one: formal verification.  We argue that quantum programs demand machine-checkable proofs of correctness. We justify this on the basis of the complexity of programs manipulating quantum states, the expense of running quantum programs, and the inapplicability of traditional debugging techniques to programs whose states cannot be examined. We further argue that the existing mathematical models of quantum computation make this an easier task than one could reasonably expect. In light of these observations we introduce QWIRE, a tool for writing verifiable, large scale quantum programs.  QWIRE is not merely a language for writing and verifying quantum circuits: it is a verified circuit description language. This means that the semantics of QWIRE circuits are verified in the Coq proof assistant. We also implement verified abstractions, like ancilla management and reversible circuit compilation. Finally, we turn QWIRE and Coq's abilities outwards, towards verifying popular quantum algorithms like quantum teleportation. We argue that this tool provides a solid foundation for research into quantum programming languages and formal verification going forward.

The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) find an appropriate definition of invariants for quantum programs; and (ii) develop an effective technique of invariant generation for verification and analysis of quantum programs.  Interestingly, the notion of invariant can be defined for quantum programs in two different ways -- additive invariants and multiplicative invariants -- corresponding to two interpretations of implication in a continuous valued logic: the Lukasiewicz implication and the Godel implication. It is shown that both of them can be used to establish partial correctness of quantum programs.  The problem of generating additive invariants of quantum programs is addressed by reducing it to an SDP (Semidefinite Programming) problem. This approach is applied with an SDP solver to generate invariants of two important quantum algorithms -- quantum walk and quantum Metropolis sampling. Our examples show that the generated invariants can be used to verify correctness of these algorithms and are helpful in optimising quantum Metropolis sampling.  To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to define the notion of invariant and to develop a method of invariant generation for quantum programs.

A new quantum programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of superposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of Dijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation (of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs. The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new mathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions. Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived. Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and generalizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum alternation and quantum choice. We believe that quantum programming with quantum alternation and choice will play an important role in further exploiting the power of quantum computing.","tags":[],"title":"Alternation in Quantum Programming: From Superposition of Data to Superposition of Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dave Wecker","Krysta M.

Sharir, A. Pnueli, S. Hart, Verification of probabilistic programs, SIAM Journal of Computing 13 (1984) 292--314] presented a general method for proving properties of probabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov chain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended to an invariant assertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a probabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method. In this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains which are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the Schrödinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In particular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification method of quantum programs is established.  - As indicated by the completeness theorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying all properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian operators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications because of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the case of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of quantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing the matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of matrices. In particular, this method enables us to compute easily the average running time and to analyze some interesting long-run behaviors of quantum programs in a finite-dimensional state space.

Over the years, physicists have explored possibilities for how to implement quantum bits and logic devices in hardware. At a higher level, mathematicians and algorithmicists have explored how to express computational problems from diverse fields---such as cryptography, chemical systems simulation, and database search---in terms of mathematical equations potentially implementable in quantum hardware.  For quantum computing to become potentially viable however, research must also make inroads regarding the implementation, compilation, and architectural issues that lie between high-level mathematical algorithm expressions and low-level physical implementations. In particular, we need tools and analysis techniques that can---for a given algorithm and potential physical implementation technology---answer questions like: how much would it cost (i.e., how much resource in terms of qubits, gates, time are required?) to implement the algorithm in this technology? What is its performance potential? Is it scalable? Are there more algorithms that offer such speedups over classical computers?  Our work is building a language and toolflow to answer such questions. This document describes the Scaffold programming language, its design goals, and related tools. Scaffold is a programming language for expressing quantum algorithms. A quantum algorithm can consist of a wide variety of components (including classical and quantum routines) which will be defined using different coding techniques.

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ``cobordism'': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and ``quantum topology''. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ``closed symmetric monoidal category''.

The key idea is to start from an entangled state and then use measurements and one-qubit unitaries, which may be dependent on the outcomes of measurements, to guide the computation. The main point is that one never has to perform unitaries on more than one qubit at a time after the initial preparation of an entangled state.

Our approach is based on recasting the standard axiomatic presentation of quantum mechanics, due to von Neumann, at a more abstract level, of compact closed categories with biproducts. We show how the essential structures found in key quantum information protocols such as teleportation, logic-gate teleportation, and entanglement-swapping can be captured at this abstract level. Moreover, from the combination of the --apparently purely qualitative-- structures of compact closure and biproducts there emerge `scalars` and a `Born rule'. This abstract and structural point of view opens up new possibilities for describing and reasoning about quantum systems. It also shows the degrees of axiomatic freedom: we can show what requirements are placed on the (semi)ring of scalars C(I,I), where C is the category and I is the tensor unit, in order to perform various protocols such as teleportation. Our formalism captures both the information-flow aspect of the protocols (see quant-ph/0402014), and the branching due to quantum indeterminism. This contrasts with the standard accounts, in which the classical information flows are `outside' the usual quantum-mechanical formalism.","tags":[],"title":"A Categorical Semantics of Quantum Protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Selinger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1080777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628702283,"objectID":"9d1a4ecd01d1c9686699aeca66689cdb","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/selinger-2004/","publishdate":"2021-08-12T15:41:28.610799Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/selinger-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"This article is a brief and subjective survey of quantum programming language research.","tags":[],"title":"A Brief Survey of Quantum Programming Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

This paper investigates a possible approach to the problem of programming such machines: a template high level quantum language is presented which complements a generic general purpose classical language with a set of quantum primitives. The underlying scheme involves a run-time environment which calculates the byte-code for the quantum operations and pipes it to a quantum device controller or to a simulator. This language can compactly express existing quantum algorithms and reduce them to sequences of elementary operations; it also easily lends itself to automatic, hardware independent, circuit simplification. A publicly available preliminary implementation of the proposed ideas has been realised using the language.","tags":[],"title":"Toward an Architecture for Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Ömer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1051747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628702281,"objectID":"d4a30fc5f6e7ede4aa74b5f9dd4ad83a","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/oemer-2003/","publishdate":"2021-08-12T15:41:25.775677Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/oemer-2003/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Structured Quantum Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emmanuel Knill"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":833587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628702280,"objectID":"88f7c7676aab7701bab5dd51d8b8a603","permalink":"https://quantumpl.github.io/bib/publication/knill-1996/","publishdate":"2021-08-12T15:41:24.409638Z","relpermalink":"/bib/publication/knill-1996/","section":"publication","summary":"A few conventions for thinking about and writing quantum pseudocode are proposed.
