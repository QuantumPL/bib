 abstract = {We formalize quantum Hoare logic [TOPLAS 33(6),19]. In particular, we specify the syntax and denotational semantics of a simple model of quantum programs. Then, we write down the rules of quantum Hoare logic for partial correctness, and show the soundness and completeness of the resulting proof system. As an application, we verify the correctness of Grover's algorithm.},
