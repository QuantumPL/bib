 abstract = {We present a formalization in Isabelle/HOL of quantum projective measurements, a class of measurements involving orthogonal projectors that is frequently used in quantum computing. We also formalize the CHSH inequality, a result that holds on arbitrary probability spaces, which can used to disprove the existence of a local hidden-variable theory for quantum mechanics.},
