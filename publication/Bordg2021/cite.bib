 abstract = {In this article we present an ongoing effort to formalise quantum algorithms and results in quantum information theory using the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Formal methods being critical for the safety and security of algorithms and protocols, we foresee their widespread use for quantum computing in the future. We have developed a large library for quantum computing in Isabelle based on a matrix representation for quantum circuits, successfully formalising the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's algorithm, the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma. We discuss the design choices made and report on an outcome of our work in the field of quantum game theory.},
