 abstract = {ZX-Calculus is a versatile graphical language for quantum computation equipped with an equational theory. Getting inspiration from Geometry of Interaction, in this paper we propose a token-machine-based asynchronous model of both pure ZX-Calculus and its extension to mixed processes. We also show how to connect this new semantics to the usual standard interpretation of ZX-diagrams. This model allows us to have a new look at what ZX-diagrams compute, and give a more local, operational view of the semantics of ZX-diagrams.},
