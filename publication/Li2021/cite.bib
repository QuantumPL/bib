 abstract = {We present a variant of the quantum relational Hoare logic from (Unruh, POPL 2019) that allows us to use "expectations" in pre- and postconditions. That is, when reasoning about pairs of programs, our logic allows us to quantitatively reason about how much certain pre-/postconditions are satisfied that refer to the relationship between the programs inputs/outputs.},
