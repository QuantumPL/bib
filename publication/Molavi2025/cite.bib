 abstract = {Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the dependency structure of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via simulated annealing, a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.},
