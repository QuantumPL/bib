 abstract = {We present a generic theory of ``registers'' in imperative programs and instantiate it in the classical and quantum setting. Roughly speaking, a register is some mutable part of the program state. Mutable classical variables and quantum registers and wires in quantum circuits are examples of this. However, registers in our setting can also refer to subparts of other registers, or combinations of parts from different registers, or quantum registers seen in a different basis, etc. Our formalization is intended to be well suited for formalization in theorem provers and as a foundation for modeling quantum/classical variables in imperative programs.
We study the quantum registers in greater detail and cover the infinite-dimensional case as well.
We implemented a large part of our results (including a minimal quantum Hoare logic and an analysis of quantum teleportation) in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.},
