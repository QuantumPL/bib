 abstract = {We develop a linear logical framework within the Hybrid system and use it to reason about the type system of a quantum lambda calculus. In particular, we consider a practical version of the calculus called Proto-Quipper, which contains the core of Quipper. Quipper is a quantum programming language under active development and recently has gained much popularity among the quantum computing communities. Hybrid is a system that is designed to support the use of higher-order abstract syntax for representing and reasoning about formal systems implemented in the Coq Proof Assistant. In this work, we extend the system with a linear specification logic (SL) in order to reason about the linear type system of Quipper. To this end, we formalize the semantics of Proto-Quipper by encoding the typing and evaluation rules in the SL, and prove type soundness.},
