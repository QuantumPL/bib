 abstract = {This work contains a formalization of quantum projective measurements, also known as von Neumann measurements, which are based on elements of spectral theory. We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality involving expectations in a probability space that is violated by quantum measurements, thus proving that quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory.},
