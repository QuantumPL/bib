 abstract = {In this paper, we define the operational and denotational semantics of a special class of parallel quantum programs, namely disjoint parallel quantum programs. Based on them, a proof system for reasoning about disjoint parallel quantum programs is developed, which is (relatively) complete even when entanglement between different processes appears in the preconditions and postconditions.},
