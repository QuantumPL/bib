 abstract = {Model checking is one of the most successful verification techniques and has been widely adopted in traditional computing and communication hardware and software industries. This book provides the first systematic introduction to model checking techniques applicable to quantum systems, with broad potential applications in the emerging industry of quantum computing and quantum communication as well as quantum physics. Suitable for use as a course textbook and for self-study, graduate and senior undergraduate students will appreciate the step-by-step explanations and the exercises included. Researchers and engineers in the related fields can further develop these techniques in their own work, with the final chapter outlining potential future applications.},
