 abstract = {Distributed quantum systems and especially the Quantum Internet have the ever-increasing potential to fully demonstrate the power of quantum computation. This is particularly true given that developing a general-purpose quantum computer is much more difficult than connecting many small quantum devices. One major challenge of implementing distributed quantum systems is programming them and verifying their correctness. In this paper, we propose a CSP-like distributed programming language to facilitate the specification and verification of such systems. After presenting its operational and denotational semantics, we develop a Hoare-style logic for distributed quantum programs and establish its soundness and (relative) completeness with respect to both partial and total correctness. The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated by its applications in the verification of quantum teleportation and local implementation of non-local CNOT gates, two important algorithms widely used in distributed quantum systems.},
