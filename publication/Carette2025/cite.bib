 abstract = {We construct a computationally universal quantum programming language QuantumΠ from two copies of Π, the internal language of rig groupoids. The first step constructs a pure (measurement-free) term language by interpreting each copy of Π in a generalisation of the category Unitary in which every morphism is "rotated" by a particular angle, and the two copies are amalgamated using a free categorical construction expressed as a computational effect. The amalgamated language only exhibits quantum behaviour for specific values of the rotation angles, a property which is enforced by imposing a small number of equations on the resulting category. The second step in the construction introduces measurements by layering an additional computational effect.},
