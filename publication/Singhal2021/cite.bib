 abstract = {Q\# is a high-level programming language from Microsoft for writing and running quantum programs. Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. Further, currently, the Q\# type system cannot statically prevent cloning of qubits. We aim to provide a formal specification and semantics for Q\#, placing the language on a solid mathematical foundation, enabling further evolution of its design and type system (including enforcing no-cloning). This paper describes our current progress in designing λ-Q\# (an idealized version of Q\#), our solution to the qubit cloning problem in λ-Q\#, and outlines the next steps.},
