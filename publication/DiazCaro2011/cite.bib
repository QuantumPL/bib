 abstract = {This paper demonstrates how to add a measurement operator to quantum Î»-calculi. A proof of the consistency of the semantics is given through a proof of confluence presented in a sufficiently general way to allow this technique to be used for other languages. The method described here may be applied to probabilistic rewrite systems in general, and to add measurement to more complex languages such as QML [Grattage, J. and T. Altenkirch, A functional quantum programming language, in: LICS '05: Proceedings of the 20th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (2005), pp. 249--258] or Lineal [Arrighi, P. and G.
