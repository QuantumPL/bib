 abstract = {A formalization of the theory of quantum and classical registers as developed by (Unruh, Quantum and Classical Registers). In a nutshell, a register refers to a part of a larger memory or system that can be accessed independently. Registers can be constructed from other registers and several (compatible) registers can be composed. This formalization develops both the generic theory of registers as well as specific instantiations for classical and quantum registers.},
