 abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms are hybrid classical-quantum algorithms where classical and quantum computation work in tandem to solve computational problems. These algorithms create interesting challenges for the design of suitable programming languages. In this paper we introduce Qimaera, which is a set of libraries for the Idris 2 programming language that enable the programmer to implement (variational) quantum algorithms where the full power of the elegant Idris language works in synchrony with quantum programming primitives that we introduce. The two key ingredients of Idris that make this possible are (1) dependent types which allow us to implement unitary (i.e. reversible and controllable) quantum operations; and (2) linearity which allows us to enforce fine-grained control over the execution of quantum operations that ensures compliance with the laws of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that Qimaera is suitable for variational quantum programming by providing implementations of the two most prominent variational quantum algorithms -- QAOA and VQE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of these algorithms that has been achieved in a type-safe framework.}
