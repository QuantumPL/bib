 abstract = {We advance the thesis that the simulation of quantum circuits is fundamentally about the efficient management of a large (potentially exponential) number of delimited continuations. The family of Scheme languages, with its efficient implementations of first-class continuations and with its imperative constructs, provides an elegant host for modeling and simulating quantum circuits.},
