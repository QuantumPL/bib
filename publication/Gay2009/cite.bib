 abstract = {The study of computational processes based on the laws of quantum mechanics has led to the discovery of new algorithms, cryptographic techniques, and communication primitives. This book explores quantum computation from the perspective of the branch of theoretical computer science known as semantics, as an alternative to the more well-known studies of algorithmics, complexity theory, and information theory. It collects chapters from leading researchers in the field, discussing the theory of quantum programming languages, logics and tools for reasoning about quantum systems, and novel approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics. This book is suitable for graduate students and researchers in quantum information and computation, as well as those in semantics, who want to learn about a new field arising from the application of semantic techniques to quantum information and computation.},
