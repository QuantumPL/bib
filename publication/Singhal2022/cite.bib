 abstract = {Q\# is a standalone domain-specific programming language from Microsoft for writing and running quantum programs. Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. We aim to provide a formal language definition for Q\#, placing the language on a solid mathematical foundation and enabling further evolution of its design and type system. This paper presents λ-Q\#, an idealized version of Q\# that illustrates how we may view Q\# as a quantum Algol (algorithmic language). We show the safety properties enforced by λ-Q\#'s type system and present its equational semantics based on a fully complete algebraic theory by Staton.},
